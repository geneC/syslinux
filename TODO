*** To do in the short term:

- PXELINUX: Support changing the default server and boot file prefix?

- Support loading a new configuration file.

- "Shuffle and boot" extension, with the appropriate com32 library
  support.

- Library support for all the comboot system calls.


*** Future projects:

- Clean up the command-line parsing.

- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.

- Subdirectory support in SYSLINUX.

- Support files that span multiple input media (SYSLINUX)
  -> Seems to be getting less important; floppies are dying?

- Clean up the handling of sections

- Add "localboot" support to SYSLINUX (using the ISOLINUX feature
  set.)
  OBSOLETE: chain.c32 is probably better.
