Changes in 1.32:
	* FAT16 is now supported.

Changes in 1.31:
	* Now compiles under Linux, using NASM, rather than using
	  Turbo Assembler under DOS.  See http://www.cryogen.com/Nasm
	  for information about NASM.
	* Perl script to install SYSLINUX under Linux, as well as a
	  rewritten DOS installer (now is written in assembler, so we
	  don't need Turbo C.)

Changes in 1.30:
        * Added support for loading bzImage and initrd loading, and made
          SYSLINUX new-setup-code aware (SYSLINUX 1.30 id=0x31).
        * Added LILO-style kernel labels; see the LABEL and IMPLICIT
          keywords in README file.
        * Added support for colorization of intro and help screens.
        * The vga= option is now handled correctly.
        * Massive rewrite of large chunks of the code in order to
          support the first two new features.

Changes in 1.20:
        * Added simple online help at the "boot:" prompt.
        * Removed 2880K image as I no longer have access to such a
          floppy drive.  (Donations accepted!!)
        * Decided to distribute the source in a subdirectory rather
          than in a nested zipfile.

Changes in 1.11:
        * Removed a sanity check which would cause booting to fail on
          Phoenix BIOS version 4.03.  Apparently this BIOS is buggy.

Changes in 1.10:
        * Added configuration file SYSLINUX.CFG.  This file contains all
          configurable options, and can be edited from any OS which can
          access an MS-DOS filesystem; there is no longer a need to run
          SYSLINUX.EXE except to write the boot sector.
        * Default command line now given by "default" line in config
          file.
        * LINUXMSG.TXT and BOOTMSG.TXT hard-coded file names replaced by
          "display" and "prompt" lines in config file.
        * LILO-style option appending now supported ("append" line in
          config file).
        * Prompt timeout is now supported ("timeout" line in config
          file).  The timeout is cancelled when anything is typed on the
          command line.
        * Pressing <ESC> or <Ctrl-C> at the Loading... stage now aborts
          the kernel loading in progress and returns the user to the
          boot: prompt.
        * The installer now automatically sets the READONLY flag on
          LDLINUX.SYS.
	* Added 2880K disk image.

Changes in 1.03:
	* Fixed bug that would prevent booting from double-density
	  floppies and other DOS filesystems with multiple sectors per
	  cluster.
	* Added 720K disk image.
	* Changed default kernel name on disk images to LINUX.

Changes in 1.02:
        * Fixed bug that would garble the command line on recent kernels
          with more than 4 sectors of setup code (this wasn't really a
          *bug*; rather, a kernel change broke the code.  Unfortunately
          the Linux boot interface is still sorely undocumented).
        * Added BOOTMSG.TXT file support (message file which does not
          force display of the boot prompt).

Changes in 1.01:
        * Fixed bug on some (most?) 386 BIOSes would require two boot
          attempts.
